    <p>
       Pandas are offtly known for there distinctive trade mark of having black and white colors. <br> 
       Pandas eyes are designed to be nocturnal allowing them to see and adequately move during the night.  <br>
       With all of this moving im sure your asking "What do they eat to make sure they stay this gelatinous?"<br> 
       You will be surprised 99% of pandas deits consits of bamboo. Now this might pose another question to you <br>
       "If they eat so light why are they so big?" Well this so called <strong>"bamboo"</strong> can actully kill <br>
       a human being being that it consists of cyanide.
